# 🎉 Final Project: Jolly Kid – A Classic E-Commerce Store for Children's Clothing

Jolly Kid is a full-stack e-commerce application for children's clothing, built with React, Node.js, and MongoDB. Our goal was to create a classic online store where users can browse products, filter by category, add items to their shopping cart, register, log in, and complete purchases via Stripe.

This project was developed by two developers, working closely together to divide tasks efficiently and build a complete solution from frontend to backend.

## 🛠 Technical Requirements

We have implemented a modern and responsive web store that meets the following technical requirements:

✅ Frontend in React – Routing via React Router and global state management via Zustand & useState

✅ Backend in Node.js & Express – Handling products, user authentication, and payments

✅ MongoDB database – Storing users, products, and orders

✅ Authentication – Secure login and user registration

✅ Payment integration – Seamless checkout experience via Stripe

✅ Responsive design – Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop

✅ Accessibility compliance – Following WCAG standards

## 📌 Key Features

🛍 Product listing & filtering – Users can browse products and filter by category, with selected filters reflected in the URL using query parameters.

🛒 Shopping cart – Users can manage their cart, including adding, removing, and adjusting item quantities.

🔑 User management – Registration, login, and authentication.

💳 Checkout & payment – Smooth Stripe integration for secure transactions.

🎨 Modern UI/UX – Styled with Styled Components, React Icons, and a clean, minimalistic look.

## 🚀 Future Improvements (If We Had More Time)
If we had more time, we would have refined and expanded the project in the following ways:

🔹 State Management Consistency – Currently, we mix useState and Zustand for state handling. A more scalable solution would be to manage all state via Zustand.

🔹 Global Styling Enhancements – We would introduce more global design properties for elements like margin, padding, and font sizes to ensure consistency across the app.

🔹 Component Reusability – Some components, like buttons, could be further modularized and reused across the application to improve maintainability.

🔹 Enhanced User Dashboard – When a user logs in, they currently only see a welcome message. We would improve the experience by displaying:
- Liked/favorited products
- Order history & past purchases
